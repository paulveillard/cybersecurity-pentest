# Penetration Testing (Pentest) Commnunity
An ongoing & curated collection of awesome software best practices and techniques, libraries and frameworks, E-books and videos, websites, blog posts, links to github Repositories, technical guidelines and important resources about Penetration Testing (Pentest) in Cybersecurity.
> Thanks to all contributors, you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you! Our goal is to build a categorized community-driven collection of very well-known resources.

##  `What is Penetration Testing? `
[Penetration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test), also known as pen testing, security pen testing, and security testing, is a form of ethical hacking. A penetration test, also called a pen test or ethical hacking, is a cybersecurity technique organizations use to identify, test and highlight vulnerabilities in their security posture.

###  `Penetration Testing is important for the following key reasons: `
- To determine the weakness in the infrastructure (hardware), application (software) and people in order to develop controls
- To ensure controls have been implemented and are effective â€“ this provides assurance to information security and senior management
- To test applications that are often the avenues of attack (Applications are built by people who can make mistakes despite best practices in software development)
- To discover new bugs in existing software (patches and updates can fix existing vulnerabilities, but they can also introduce new vulnerabilities)

> For best practices on vulnerability disclosure guidelines, please follow [this guidance](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/guidance/) to report it responsibly.
