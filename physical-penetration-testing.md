# Physical Penetration Testing
Physical penetration tests are one of the four main types of penetration testing, along with network, application, and IoT/Mobile tests. The objective of this test is to identify vulnerability exploits in your physical properties that could lead to vulnerable vectors for an attacker to exploit for some nefarious purpose.


In the world of cyber security, physical penetration tests point out some of the most common physical vulnerabilities for a company. Physical penetration tests are also referred to as “physical intrusion testing”. This is because these type of penetration tests identify opportunities to compromise the physical barriers of your company, including sensors, camera, and locks. The goal of this test is to identify weaknesses in your physical security controls. This is often done at important locations such as data centers, substations, or offices. Identifying these weaknesses and taking appropriate actions to remedy them will prevent unauthorized individuals from entering your premises and compromising assets.

## Why Pentest Your Physical Assets?
The purpose of physical penetration testing is to identify real-world vulnerabilities that attackers could possibly use to exploit and infiltrate your physical properties and data. These vulnerabilities are further analyzed and then remedied to avoid an actual application compromise. Holes in your physical systems may seem like a lesser issue when compared to other penetration tests, but some of your most valuable data is stored at the physical location your company operates at.

 

Even one successful attack on a physical vector could mean certain doom for your company. As physical security technology has evolved, compromising the system has proven to be more difficult. However, this doesn’t stop motivated and intelligent individuals from trying and often succeeding in their quest for information. A breach in physical security is devastating for your company, and the importance of strong security controls cannot be understated.
