## What Is Penetration Testing?
We can figure out the vulnerabilities of a computer system, a web application or a network through penetration testing.

A penetration test will tell whether the existing defensive measures employed on the system are strong enough to prevent any security breaches. Penetration test reports also suggest countermeasures which can be taken to reduce the risk of the system being hacked.
