## `What Is Penetration Testing?`
We can figure out the vulnerabilities of a computer system, a web application or a network through penetration testing.

A penetration test will tell whether the existing defensive measures employed on the system are strong enough to prevent any security breaches. Penetration test reports also suggest countermeasures which can be taken to reduce the risk of the system being hacked.

## `Causes of Vulnerability`
### `Design and Development Errors:`
There can be flaws in the design of hardware and software. These bugs can put your business-critical data at risk of exposure.

### Poor System Configuration: 
This is another cause of vulnerability. If the system is poorly configured, then it can introduce loopholes through which attackers can enter into the system & steal the information.

### Human errors: 
Human factors like improper disposal of documents, leaving the documents unattended, coding errors, insider threats, sharing passwords over phishing sites, etc. can lead to security breaches.

### Connectivity: If the system is connected to an unsecured network (open connections) then it comes within the reach of hackers.


### Complexity: 
The security vulnerability rises in proportion to the complexity of a system. The more features a system has, the more are the chances of the system being attacked.


Password: Passwords are used to prevent unauthorized access. They should be strong enough that no one can guess your password. Passwords should not be shared with anyone at any cost and passwords should be changed periodically. In spite of these instructions, at times people reveal their passwords to others, write them down somewhere and keep easy passwords that can be guessed.
User Input: You must have heard of SQL injection, buffer overflows, etc. The data received electronically through these methods can be used to attack the receiving system.
Management: Security is hard & expensive to manage. Sometimes organizations lack behind in proper risk management and hence vulnerability gets induced in the system.
Lack of training to staff: This leads to human errors and other vulnerabilities.
Communication: Channels like mobile networks, internet, telephone opens up security theft scope.
